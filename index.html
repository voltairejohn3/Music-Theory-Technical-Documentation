            <p>Music has accompanied and evolved with human beings characterized by the culture, history and geographic locations.</p> 
            <p>This post is an introduction to music theory covering basic concepts in western music.<br> Read more to learn about western music theory for complete beginners.</p>

            <p><code>Music is the Melodies Unison of Sounds In Composition</code></p>
            <p>Each of these words – melody, unison, sound and composition has its own definitions. The combined amalgamation of these musical concepts make is referred to as an art of expressing emotions through pleasing sounds.</p>

            <p>Music is a beautiful amalgamation of various fundamental concepts like expression, melody and rhythm. In Indian classical music, we call it Bhava (Expression), Raga (Melody) and Tala (Rhythm)
            Here’s the first musical mathematics formula, I would like to define in music theory.<br><br>
        
              <code>Music = Expression + Melody + Rhythm</code><br><br>
        
        There are other essential ingredients like<br>
              <ul>
              <li>Tone</li>
              <li>Accidentals</li>
              <li>Harmonics</li>
              <li>Intervals</li>
              <li>Pitch</li>
              <li>Scales</li>
              <li>Chords</li>
              <li>Harmony</li></p>
              </ul>
            
         <h4>Expression</h4>
        <p>Ever heard of a song that didn’t had any human emotions? Nobody would play or hear music without any reason. Listening to happy music is your choice to celebrate joy and happiness around you. Writing a sad composition is your choice to convey a sad story.</p><br><br>
        
        <h4>Rhythm</h4>
        <p>Everything that exist along with our existence exist in a rhythm. Earth’s rotation, our heart beats, the way we walk, our daily routine etc. <code>These periodic cycles based on time intervals is referred to as rhythm in music theory.?</code></p><br><br>
        
        <h4>Melody</h4>
        <p>Melody is defined as the set of musical notes played in a specific pattern one after the other to create euphonic sounds.<br><br></p>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Musical_Notes">
            <header class="content-cap">Musical Notes</header>
            <p>Note is the basic element of music used to compose music. Technically, a note can be defined as a sound of a specific frequency which can be identified on account of it’s unique characteristic.</p>
            <p><code>In western music the primary notes are represented using English alphabets as A, B, C, D, E, F, G.</code><br><br> Accidentals are the symbols that can be used to describe types of notes briefly characterized as natural, sharp and flat notes.<br><br> Furthermore, accidentals describes the relative highs and lows for any note based on the intervals present on the musical instruments.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Scale,Chord,Harmony">
            <header class="content-cap">Scale,Chord,Harmony</header>
            <p><strong>Scale</strong> is systematic arrangement of notes played one after the another that should necessarily have a root note. All other notes in this sequence is based on specific musical formula.<br><br>
        
              <strong>Chord</strong> is the unified sound generated from any musical instruments when several notes are played at a time. Again the combination of notes depend on specific formula that may characterize specific human emotions.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Harmony</strong> is defined as the tunefulness related to combination of several musical notes.<br><code>Euphony, polyphony and consonance are all the same.</code></p>
            
            <p>As an introduction to music theory, explaining above terminologies would be too difficult in a single post. This just a basic knowledge we need to know about music.</p>
